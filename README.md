# Drunken Blimp Assassins

This is a small experiment to create a game using the HTML 5 Canvas. The name of the game was chosen by [The Video Game Name Generator](https://videogamena.me/).

## Plot
While drinking some ginger ale at local inn, you overhear a group of people boasting about their plans to assassinate the local mayor. You can tell they are really, really drunk. The scheme is a grand one, as they are planning to do it at the same that that it happens in many other locations tonight. Your job is to save as many people as you can, and stop the assassinations!

## Gameplay

Just like the assassins, you have a pirate ship outfitted with a balloon that lets you fly the boat. Find all the assassins and stop them.
